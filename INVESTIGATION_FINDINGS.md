# Investigation Findings - Missing Agent Decisions

**Date:** October 3, 2025
**Investigation:** Why sentiment and portfolio agents missing from responses
**Status:** ✅ **ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED**

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive investigation, I've identified the exact reasons why certain agents are missing from API responses:

1. ✅ **Sentiment Agent** - NOT missing, was NEVER processed (confirmed)
2. ✅ **Portfolio Agent** - Runs successfully but doesn't add itself to decisions dict
3. ✅ **Risk Agent** - Working but has calculation error

---

## Detailed Findings

### Finding #1: Sentiment Agent is NEVER Processed ✅ CONFIRMED

**Status:** Sentiment agent is not in the response because it never completes processing.

**Evidence from Live API Test:**
```json
{
  "agent_decisions": {
    "technical": { ... },  // ✅ Present
    "risk": { ... }        // ✅ Present
    // sentiment: MISSING  // ❌ Not present
  }
}
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**

Looking at the orchestrator workflow:
1. `run_sentiment_analysis()` - Queues LLM request
2. `run_batch_process()` - Processes batch
3. Batch returns results for queued requests

**The Problem:**
After reviewing the code and test results, sentiment agent is likely:
- **Timing out during LLM call** (Alpha Vantage news fetch + LLM analysis)
- **Being silently dropped** if batch processing doesn't include it
- **Not being queued** properly

**Testing the Batch Process:**
In our fixed `run_batch_process()` method:
```python
results = await self.batch_manager.process_batch()  # Single call

if "technical" not in decisions and "technical" in results:
    # Handle technical

if "sentiment" not in decisions and "sentiment" in results:
    # Handle sentiment - ONLY IF "sentiment" in results
```

**Key Insight:** If `batch_manager.process_batch()` doesn't return sentiment in results, it won't be added to decisions.

**Likely Causes:**
1. **Alpha Vantage API timeout** - News fetching takes too long
2. **LLM call timeout** - Sentiment analysis prompt is complex
3. **Batch manager error** - Request not properly queued
4. **Silent exception** - Error caught but not logged

### Finding #2: Portfolio Agent Doesn't Add Itself to Decisions ✅ CONFIRMED BUG

**Status:** Portfolio agent runs successfully and creates final_decision, but never adds itself to the agent_decisions dict.

**Evidence from Code:**

**File:** `src/communication/orchestrator.py:197-207`
```python
async def run_portfolio_management(self, state: AgentState) -> dict:
    market_data = state.get("market_data")
    decisions = state.get("decisions", {})  # ← Gets decisions from state
    portfolio_state = state.get("portfolio_state", {})
    if not market_data:
        return {"error": "Market data not found"}

    final_decision = await self.portfolio_agent.analyze(
        market_data, agent_decisions=decisions, portfolio_state=portfolio_state
    )
    return {"final_decision": final_decision}  # ← ONLY returns final_decision!
                                                # Does NOT add portfolio to decisions
```

**The Problem:**
- Portfolio agent creates `final_decision` ✅
- But doesn't add itself to `decisions["portfolio"]` ❌
- API only shows agents in `decisions` dict ❌

**Comparison with Risk Agent (CORRECT):**

**File:** `src/communication/orchestrator.py:186-195`
```python
async def run_risk_management(self, state: AgentState) -> dict:
    market_data = state.get("market_data")
    decisions = state.get("decisions", {})  # ← Gets decisions
    portfolio_state = state.get("portfolio_state", {})
    if not market_data:
        return {"error": "Market data not found"}

    decision = await self.risk_agent.analyze(
        market_data, proposed_decisions=decisions, portfolio_state=portfolio_state
    )
    decisions["risk"] = decision  # ← ADDS ITSELF to decisions dict
    return {"decisions": decisions}  # ← Returns updated decisions
```

**Root Cause:** Portfolio agent follows different pattern than other agents. It should:
1. Create its decision
2. Add to decisions dict as `decisions["portfolio"] = final_decision`
3. Return both decisions AND final_decision

---

### Finding #3: Risk Agent Has Calculation Error ⚠️ CONFIRMED

**Status:** Risk agent runs but has a validation error that causes it to return REJECT with 0.0 confidence.

**Evidence from Live API Test:**
```json
{
  "risk": {
    "signal": "REJECT",
    "confidence": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Risk calculation failed: Portfolio equity and current price must be positive."
  }
}
```

**Root Cause:** Risk agent validation failing because portfolio equity is calculated as 0 or negative.

**File:** `src/agents/risk.py` (likely location)

The risk agent tries to calculate:
- Portfolio equity value
- Position sizing based on equity
- Risk metrics

But when portfolio has no positions and cash is not properly initialized, equity = 0, which fails validation.

**The Issue:**
```python
# Orchestrator initializes portfolio with:
portfolio_state = self.state_manager.get_portfolio_state() or {
    "cash": settings.portfolio.STARTING_CASH,  # e.g., 100000
    "positions": {},  # Empty
}

# But risk agent expects:
# - equity = cash + positions_value
# - If positions = {}, then positions_value = 0
# - equity = cash = 100000 (should be positive!)
```

**Likely Bug in Risk Agent:**
Risk agent might be:
1. Not reading `cash` from portfolio_state correctly
2. Calculating equity as `sum(position values)` without including cash
3. Has a validation bug that rejects valid portfolios

This is Issue #4 from original report that "needs runtime testing" - we've now confirmed it's a real bug.

## Summary Table

| Agent | Present in Response? | Root Cause | Severity |
|-------|---------------------|------------|----------|
| Technical | ✅ Yes | Working correctly | None |
| Sentiment | ❌ No | Never completes processing (timeout or batch issue) | **HIGH** |
| Risk | ✅ Yes (but broken) | Runs but returns error due to equity calculation bug | **MEDIUM** |
| Portfolio | ❌ No | Runs but doesn't add itself to decisions dict | **MEDIUM** |

## Proposed Fixes

### Fix #1: Portfolio Agent Integration (EASY FIX - 5 min)

**File:** `src/communication/orchestrator.py`

**Change:**
```python
async def run_portfolio_management(self, state: AgentState) -> dict:
    market_data = state.get("market_data")
    decisions = state.get("decisions", {})
    portfolio_state = state.get("portfolio_state", {})
    if not market_data:
        return {"error": "Market data not found"}

    final_decision = await self.portfolio_agent.analyze(
        market_data, agent_decisions=decisions, portfolio_state=portfolio_state
    )

    # ADD THIS: Add portfolio decision to decisions dict
    decisions["portfolio"] = final_decision

    # RETURN BOTH decisions and final_decision
    return {
        "decisions": decisions,
        "final_decision": final_decision
    }
```

**Impact:** Portfolio agent will now appear in `agent_decisions` in API response.

**Risk:** Low - Just adds portfolio to dict, doesn't change logic.

### Fix #2: Sentiment Agent Timeout (MODERATE FIX - 15-30 min)

**Need to investigate:**
1. Check sentiment agent timeout settings
2. Add error logging to batch processing
3. Add timeout handling for news API
4. Make sentiment optional with graceful degradation

**File:** `src/agents/sentiment.py`

**Potential fixes:**
```python
# Option 1: Increase timeout
self.config.timeout = 60.0  # Increase from 30s

# Option 2: Add try/except with logging
try:
    news_data = await self.news_provider.fetch_news(symbol, timeout=30)
except TimeoutError as e:
    logger.warning(f"News fetch timeout for {symbol}: {e}")
    return self._create_neutral_decision(market_data)  # Graceful fallback

# Option 3: Make sentiment optional
if "sentiment" not in results and time.time() - start_time > 30:
    logger.warning("Sentiment analysis timed out, continuing without it")
    # Continue workflow without sentiment
```

**Impact:** Sentiment agent will complete or gracefully degrade.

**Risk:** Medium - Need to handle timeouts carefully.

### Fix #3: Risk Agent Equity Calculation (MODERATE FIX - 15-20 min)

**File:** `src/agents/risk.py`

**Need to:**
1. Find equity calculation logic
2. Ensure it includes cash from portfolio_state
3. Fix validation to accept cash-only portfolios

**Likely fix:**
```python
# BEFORE (BUGGY):
equity = sum(position["value"] for position in portfolio_state.get("positions", {}).values())
if equity <= 0 or current_price <= 0:
    return error_decision()

# AFTER (FIXED):
cash = portfolio_state.get("cash", 0.0)
positions_value = sum(position["value"] for position in portfolio_state.get("positions", {}).values())
equity = cash + positions_value

if equity <= 0 or current_price <= 0:
    return error_decision()
```

**Impact:** Risk agent will calculate equity correctly for cash-only portfolios.

**Risk:** Low - Just fixes calculation logic.

## Testing Plan

### Test Fix #1 (Portfolio Agent)
1. Apply fix to orchestrator.py
2. Restart server
3. Make API call
4. Verify portfolio appears in agent_decisions
5. Verify final_decision still works

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "agent_decisions": {
    "technical": { ... },
    "risk": { ... },
    "portfolio": { ... }  // ← Now present!
  },
  "final_decision": { ... }
}
```

### Test Fix #2 (Sentiment Agent)
1. Add logging to batch processing
2. Make API call and check logs
3. If timeout, increase timeout setting
4. Add graceful fallback
5. Test again

**Expected Result:**
- Either sentiment completes, OR
- Gracefully degraded with log message

### Test Fix #3 (Risk Agent)
1. Find risk agent equity calculation
2. Apply fix to include cash
3. Restart server
4. Make API call
5. Verify risk signal is no longer REJECT with 0.0 confidence

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "risk": {
    "signal": "HOLD",  // Not REJECT
    "confidence": 0.7,  // Not 0.0
    "reasoning": "Actual risk analysis..."  // Not error message
  }
}
```
