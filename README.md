- **Extensible Provider Network:** Supports multiple data providers (e.g., yfinance, Alpha Vantage) and LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Google).
- **REST API:** Provides a FastAPI-based backend for interaction with the system, allowing for easy integration with other services.
- **Backtesting Framework:** Includes tools to backtest trading strategies and evaluate performance.

## Local Signal Generation Framework

The Local Signal Generation Framework enables the system to generate trading signals without relying on LLM calls. This provides significant improvements in:

- **Performance**: Signal generation latency reduced from seconds to milliseconds
- **Cost**: Up to 70% reduction in operational costs by minimizing LLM API calls
- **Reliability**: Consistent signal generation without external API dependencies

### Key Components

1. **Market Regime Detector**: Identifies current market conditions (trending, ranging, volatile)
2. **Indicator Scorer**: Evaluates multiple technical indicators and assigns scores
3. **Consensus Signal Combiner**: Aggregates indicator signals using weighted consensus
4. **Hierarchical Decision Tree**: Makes final signal decisions based on market context
5. **Signal Validator**: Validates signals against historical performance and market conditions
6. **Conflict Detector**: Identifies conflicts between different signal sources
7. **LLM Escalation Logic**: Intelligently decides when to escalate to LLM-based analysis

### Signal Types

The framework generates three types of signals:
- **BUY**: Indicates a potential upward price movement
- **SELL**: Indicates a potential downward price movement
- **HOLD**: Indicates no clear directional signal

Each signal includes:
- Signal strength (WEAK, MODERATE, STRONG, VERY_STRONG)
- Confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
- Market regime at time of generation
- Reasoning explaining the signal decision
- Contributing indicators and their weights

uv run cli.py AAPL

# Analyze multiple stocks
uv run cli.py AAPL GOOGL MSFT

# Custom time period (90 days)
uv run cli.py AAPL --days 90

# JSON output
uv run cli.py AAPL --format json

# Save results to file
uv run cli.py AAPL --output analysis.json

# Watch mode (continuous monitoring every 5 minutes)
uv run cli.py AAPL --watch --interval 300

# Analyze from watchlist file
uv run cli.py --watchlist examples/watchlist.txt
```

**Example Output:**
```

For more CLI options, run: `uv run cli.py --help`

### Running the API Server (Alternative)

The `main.py` script starts the FastAPI web server that provides API endpoints for generating trading signals:

```sh
uv run main.py
```

**What to expect when running main.py:**
```
INFO:     Started server process [12345]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

The server will start and wait for API requests. No trading analysis is performed until you make specific API calls.

### Generating Trading Signals via API

Once the server is running, you can generate trading signals by making API requests:

1. **Interactive API Documentation**: Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` in your browser
2. **Direct API Calls**: Use curl or any HTTP client to request signals

Example curl command to generate a signal for Apple (AAPL):
```sh
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/signals/AAPL?days=30"
```

**Example API Response:**
```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "analysis_period": {
    "start_date": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
    "end_date": "2023-01-31T00:00:00",
    "days": 30
  },
  "final_decision": {
    "signal": "BUY",
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "reasoning": "Technical indicators show bullish momentum with strong support at current levels...",
    "timestamp": "2023-01-31T12:00:00"
  },
  "agent_decisions": {
    "technical": {
      "signal": "BUY",
      "confidence": 0.80,
      "reasoning": "Price above key moving averages with positive MACD crossover...",
      "timestamp": "2023-01-31T12:00:00"
    },
    "sentiment": {
      "signal": "HOLD",
      "confidence": 0.60,
      "reasoning": "Mixed news sentiment with neutral analyst ratings...",
      "timestamp": "2023-01-31T12:00:00"
    },
    "risk": {
      "signal": "BUY",
      "confidence": 0.70,
      "reasoning": "Acceptable risk-reward ratio with proper position sizing...",
      "timestamp": "2023-01-31T12:00:00"
    }
  }
}
```

### Signal Generation Workflow

When you request a trading signal, the system executes this workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches market data for the requested symbol and time period
2. **Multi-Agent Analysis**: Runs analysis through specialized agents:
   - Technical Analysis Agent: Analyzes price patterns and technical indicators
   - Sentiment Analysis Agent: Analyzes news and market sentiment
   - Risk Management Agent: Evaluates risk factors
   - Portfolio Management Agent: Makes final trading decision
3. **Signal Generation**: Returns a structured response with:
   - Final signal (BUY/SELL/HOLD)
   - Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
   - Detailed reasoning for the decision
   - Individual agent decisions for transparency

### Local Signal Generation

The system includes a Local Signal Generation Framework that can produce trading signals without relying on LLM calls. You can run an example to see it in action:

```sh
uv run python examples/signal_generation_example.py
```

This example demonstrates:
- Market regime detection
- Indicator scoring and consensus building
- Signal validation and conflict detection
- Performance metrics tracking

### Alternative API Server Start Method

You can also start the API server directly with uvicorn:

```sh
uv run uvicorn src.api.app:app --reload
```

This is equivalent to running `main.py` and provides the same functionality.

### Migration Framework

The project includes a migration framework to help transition from LLM-only to hybrid signal generation:

```python
from src.migration.signal_generation_migration import initialize_migration

# Initialize migration manager
migration = initialize_migration()

# Apply current migration phase configuration
config_updates = migration.apply_phase_configuration()

# Check migration status
status = migration.get_migration_status()
print(f"Current phase: {status['phase_name']} ({status['migration_progress']:.1f}%)")
```

The migration framework supports:
- Gradual rollout of local signal generation
- Performance comparison between approaches
- Automated rollback if issues arise
- Configuration management for migration phases

### Running Tests

The AI Trading System features a comprehensive, organized testing framework with multiple test categories. The easiest way to run tests is using our universal test runner:

```sh
# Run quick tests (unit + integration) - recommended for development
uv run tests/run_all_tests.py --category quick

# Run all tests
uv run tests/run_all_tests.py --category all

# Run specific test categories
uv run tests/run_all_tests.py --category unit
uv run tests/run_all_tests.py --category integration
uv run tests/run_all_tests.py --category performance

# Run with coverage
uv run tests/run_all_tests.py --category unit --coverage
```

#### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests for individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Tests for component interactions
