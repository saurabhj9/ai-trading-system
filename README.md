# AI Trading System

An open-source project to develop a multi-agent system for financial analysis and trade signal generation. This system uses a graph-based agentic workflow to analyze assets from multiple perspectives.

**Note:** This project is in the early stages of development and is for educational and research purposes only. It is not intended for live trading.

## Core Concepts

- **Multi-Agent Analysis:** The system leverages a team of specialized AI agents (e.g., Technical Analyst, Sentiment Analyst, Risk Manager) to perform a comprehensive analysis.
- **Graph-Based Workflow:** We use LangGraph to structure the agent interactions, ensuring a stateful and logical flow of information from data gathering to final decision.
- **Backend First:** The initial focus is on building a robust backend, with a CLI and a FastAPI for interaction. A web UI is a potential future goal.
