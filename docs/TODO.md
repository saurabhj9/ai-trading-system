# TODO

This document lists the immediate, actionable tasks for the current development phase.

## Phase 6: Enhanced Technical Analysis & Local-First Strategy

This phase focuses on transforming the system from LLM-dependent to a sophisticated hybrid that leverages local processing for routine analysis and strategic LLM escalation for complex scenarios. The goal is to reduce costs by 80-90% while maintaining or improving decision quality.

#### Milestone 3.1: Configuration Architecture Refactoring
**Timeline: 1-2 days**
**Priority:** Low (Code Quality & Maintainability)
**Start Date:** TBD
**Completion Date:** TBD

**Background:**
Currently, all configuration (API keys, feature flags, business logic) is managed through `.env` files and environment variables. While this works, it mixes secrets (which should never be committed) with feature flags and business logic (which benefit from version control).

**Current State:**
- `.env` contains both API keys AND signal generation feature flags
- Feature flag changes are not version controlled
- No visibility into configuration changes in PRs
- Complex data types (lists, nested objects) stored as env vars

**Proposed Approach:**
Implement a 3-tier configuration system:

1. **Tier 1: Code Defaults** (`src/config/settings.py`)
   - Default values for all feature flags
   - Business logic configuration
   - Version controlled, visible in PRs
   - Provides sensible defaults

2. **Tier 2: Config Files** (Optional: `config/*.yaml`)
   - Environment-specific feature flags (dev/staging/prod)
   - Complex nested configurations
   - Version controlled, easy to review
   - Can have multiple files per environment

3. **Tier 3: Environment Variables** (`.env`)
   - **Only secrets and credentials**
   - API keys, database URLs, service endpoints
   - Never committed to git
   - Can override any Tier 1/2 setting for local dev

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear separation of secrets vs configuration
- ✅ Feature flag changes visible in PRs
- ✅ Better documentation through code/yaml
- ✅ Easier to maintain defaults
- ✅ Can still override locally via .env

**Implementation Steps:**
-   [ ] **Analysis & Design**
    -   [ ] Document current configuration usage patterns
    -   [ ] Design detailed 3-tier configuration architecture
    -   [ ] Define migration path and backward compatibility strategy
    -   [ ] Create configuration documentation structure

-   [ ] **Move Signal Generation Defaults**
    -   [ ] Move signal generation feature flags to `settings.py` with sensible defaults
    -   [ ] Update `.env` to only contain API keys (secrets)
    -   [ ] Update `.env.example` with override patterns and documentation
    -   [ ] Test environment variable override precedence

-   [ ] **Optional: YAML Config Support**
    -   [ ] Implement YAML config file loader (if complex configs needed)
    -   [ ] Add environment-specific config files (dev.yaml, prod.yaml)
    -   [ ] Integrate YAML config loading with pydantic-settings

-   [ ] **Documentation**
    -   [ ] Create `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` explaining the 3-tier system
    -   [ ] Document best practices for adding new configuration
    -   [ ] Add examples for common configuration scenarios
    -   [ ] Update README with configuration overview

-   [ ] **Testing & Validation**
    -   [ ] Test environment variable override behavior
    -   [ ] Validate backward compatibility
    -   [ ] Test different environment configurations (dev, staging, prod)
    -   [ ] Verify no secrets in version control
    -   [ ] Security audit for leaked secrets in git history

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] All secrets isolated in `.env` (never committed)
- [ ] All feature flags version controlled with defaults
- [ ] Configuration changes visible in PRs
- [ ] Zero secrets in git history
- [ ] Documentation covers all configuration scenarios
- [ ] Backward compatible with existing deployments

**Effort Estimate:** 4-6 hours
**Risk:** Low (backward compatible - env vars can still override)
**Priority Justification:** Low priority because current system works. This is a code quality/maintainability improvement rather than a functional requirement. Best suited for a dedicated refactoring session.

**Related Files:**
- `src/config/settings.py`
- `.env`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` (to be created)

**Notes:**
- This follows 12-factor app principles
- Common pattern in production systems
- Industry best practice for team collaboration
- Current `.env` and `.env.example` have been updated with comprehensive documentation as interim solution

-   [ ] Compare performance: local-only vs. local+LLM hybrid approaches
-   [ ] Analyze decision consistency across market regimes
-   [ ] Optimize parameters based on backtest results
-   [ ] Validate cost reduction and performance improvements
-   [ ] Create performance reports and recommendations

## Phase 3: Risk, Portfolio Management & Backtesting - COMPLETED

All Phase 3 deliverables have been implemented.

### Milestone 1: Advanced Agent Development - COMPLETED

-   [x] Create `src/agents/risk.py` with a `RiskManagementAgent` class.
-   [x] Implement basic risk calculations.
-   [x] Create `src/agents/portfolio.py` with a `PortfolioManagementAgent` class.
-   [x] Implement logic in the `PortfolioManagementAgent` to synthesize decisions from other agents.
-   [x] Update the `Orchestrator` to include the new agents in the workflow.

### Milestone 2: Backtesting Engine Setup - COMPLETED

-   [x] Chose `backtrader` as the backtesting library and added to dependencies.
-   [x] Create `src/backtesting/engine.py`.
-   [x] Implement a basic backtesting `Strategy` that uses deterministic agents for signals.
-   [x] Implement a script in `src/backtesting/run_backtest.py` to configure and run the backtesting engine.

### Milestone 3: Initial Backtest & Reporting - COMPLETED

-   [x] Run an initial backtest using the implemented strategy.
-   [x] Basic performance metrics are output in the script.
-   [x] Backtest script outputs a simple performance report.

## Phase 4: API & Deployment - COMPLETED

All Phase 4 deliverables have been implemented.

### Milestone 1: FastAPI Application Development - COMPLETED

-   [x] Create `src/api/app.py` with FastAPI application setup.
-   [x] Implement `src/api/routes/signals.py`, `src/api/routes/status.py`, and `src/api/routes/monitoring.py`.
-   [x] Set up proper dependency injection for agents.

### Milestone 2: Containerization & Orchestration - COMPLETED

-   [x] Create `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.
-   [x] Configure environment variables and service dependencies.

### Milestone 3: Production Deployment - COMPLETED

-   [x] Implement `scripts/deploy.sh` for automated deployment.
-   [x] Set up structured logging and basic monitoring.

## Phase 5: Refinement & Optimization - COMPLETED

This phase focused on replacing mock implementations with production-ready logic, externalizing configurations, and enhancing overall system performance and reliability.

### Milestone 1: Implement Core Agent Logic - COMPLETED

-   [x] **LLM Response Parsing:** Implemented robust parsing logic in all agents.
-   [x] **Sentiment Analysis Agent:** Integrated a live news data provider.
-   [x] **Risk Management Agent:** Implemented actual risk calculations.

### Milestone 2: Externalize Configurations - COMPLETED

-   [x] **Centralize Settings:** Moved hardcoded values into a structured configuration system.
-   [x] **Secure API:** Updated the FastAPI CORS policy to use configured allowed origins.

### Milestone 3: Optimization and Tuning - COMPLETED

-   [x] **Performance Analysis & Profiling:** Completed comprehensive profiling of the data pipeline, LLM client, and agent processing.
-   [x] **Implement Identified Optimizations:**
    -   [x] **LLM Response Time Optimization:** Implemented caching, connection pooling, and batching.
    -   [x] **LLM Model Evaluation:** Benchmarked models and selected `Claude-3-haiku`.
    -   [x] **Prompt Engineering & Historical Data:** Refined prompts and implemented historical data in `TechnicalAgent`.
    -   [x] **Data Pipeline Optimization:** Fixed data fetching bottlenecks and implemented parallel fetching.
    -   [x] **Agent Processing Parallelization:** Implemented parallel execution for independent agents.
-   [x] **Critical Issues Resolved:** Fixed agent serialization and parameter passing errors.
