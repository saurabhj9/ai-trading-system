# Session Summary - 2025-09-25

## Overview
This session will focus on Phase 5: Refinement & Optimization, replacing mock implementations with production-ready logic, externalizing configurations, and enhancing system performance and reliability.

## Next Set of Tasks

The next phase, Phase 5, consists of four milestones aimed at transforming the AI Trading System from a development prototype into a production-ready trading platform.

Milestone 1 focuses on implementing core agent logic. This involves developing robust parsing logic for LLM responses across all agents (Technical, Sentiment, Risk, and Portfolio) to replace the current mock decision returns with actual analysis derived from language model outputs. For the Sentiment Analysis Agent, we'll integrate a live news data provider such as NewsAPI or Alpha Vantage News to replace the static mock_news list. The Risk Management Agent will be enhanced with real risk calculations including position sizing and Value at Risk metrics, moving beyond the simple mock "APPROVE" signal.

Milestone 2 addresses configuration management. We'll centralize hardcoded values scattered throughout the codebase into a structured configuration system using .env files and a config.py loader. This includes moving LLM provider URLs and model names from files like src/llm/client.py and src/agents/data_structures.py, as well as the default portfolio starting cash from src/communication/orchestrator.py. Additionally, we'll secure the FastAPI application by updating the CORS policy to specify allowed origins instead of the current wildcard setting.

Milestone 3 emphasizes optimization and tuning. We'll conduct performance analysis to profile the data pipeline and agent processing, identifying and addressing any bottlenecks. Comprehensive backtesting cycles will be run using the full LLM-driven agent logic to properly evaluate strategy performance. Based on these results, we'll tune agent parameters and strategy rules for optimal results.

Milestone 4 enhances monitoring capabilities. An alerting mechanism will be implemented for critical system events such as repeated API failures or significant drawdowns. We'll also expand the metrics collection to include more granular data on agent performance, LLM response times, and data pipeline throughput.

## Work Completed in This Session
- Session summary file created and initialized with details of the next set of tasks for Phase 5.

## Key Insights
- Phase 5 builds on the solid foundation established in Phases 1-4, focusing on making the system production-ready by replacing mock implementations and optimizing performance.

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation with Milestone 1, starting with LLM response parsing across all agents.
- Prioritize externalizing configurations to improve system maintainability and security.
- Schedule performance profiling and comprehensive backtesting after core agent logic is implemented.
