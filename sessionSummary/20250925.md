# Session Summary - 2025-09-25

## Overview
This session will focus on Phase 5: Refinement & Optimization, replacing mock implementations with production-ready logic, externalizing configurations, and enhancing system performance and reliability.

## Next Set of Tasks

The next phase, Phase 5, consists of four milestones aimed at transforming the AI Trading System from a development prototype into a production-ready trading platform.

Milestone 1 focuses on implementing core agent logic. This involves developing robust parsing logic for LLM responses across all agents (Technical, Sentiment, Risk, and Portfolio) to replace the current mock decision returns with actual analysis derived from language model outputs. For the Sentiment Analysis Agent, we'll integrate a live news data provider such as NewsAPI or Alpha Vantage News to replace the static mock_news list. The Risk Management Agent will be enhanced with real risk calculations including position sizing and Value at Risk metrics, moving beyond the simple mock "APPROVE" signal.

Milestone 2 addresses configuration management. We'll centralize hardcoded values scattered throughout the codebase into a structured configuration system using .env files and a config.py loader. This includes moving LLM provider URLs and model names from files like src/llm/client.py and src/agents/data_structures.py, as well as the default portfolio starting cash from src/communication/orchestrator.py. Additionally, we'll secure the FastAPI application by updating the CORS policy to specify allowed origins instead of the current wildcard setting.

Milestone 3 emphasizes optimization and tuning. We'll conduct performance analysis to profile the data pipeline and agent processing, identifying and addressing any bottlenecks. Comprehensive backtesting cycles will be run using the full LLM-driven agent logic to properly evaluate strategy performance. Based on these results, we'll tune agent parameters and strategy rules for optimal results.

Milestone 4 enhances monitoring capabilities. An alerting mechanism will be implemented for critical system events such as repeated API failures or significant drawdowns. We'll also expand the metrics collection to include more granular data on agent performance, LLM response times, and data pipeline throughput.

## Work Completed in This Session
- Session summary file created and initialized with details of the next set of tasks for Phase 5.
- Completed Milestone 1 of Phase 5: Implement Core Agent Logic
  - Implemented robust LLM response parsing in all agents (Technical, Sentiment, Risk, Portfolio) to replace mock decisions with LLM-derived analysis
  - Integrated live news data provider (Alpha Vantage) for SentimentAnalysisAgent, replacing mock_news list
  - Added quantitative risk calculations (position sizing) to RiskManagementAgent
  - Updated BaseAgent to support agent-specific dependencies for better extensibility
  - Updated docs/TODO.md and docs/ROADMAP.md to reflect completion of Milestone 1
- Completed Milestone 2 of Phase 5: Externalize Configurations
  - Created a centralized configuration system in `src/config/settings.py` using `pydantic-settings`.
  - Refactored the codebase to use the new settings module, removing hardcoded values.
  - Updated `pyproject.toml` with new dependencies (`pydantic-settings`, `pytest-mock`).
  - Updated and ran integration tests to validate the changes.
  - Updated `docs/TODO.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md` to reflect the completion of Milestone 2.

## Key Insights
- Phase 5 builds on the solid foundation established in Phases 1-4, focusing on making the system production-ready by replacing mock implementations and optimizing performance.
- Externalizing configurations makes the system more secure, flexible, and easier to manage across different environments.

## Next Steps
- Milestone 1 completed: Core agent logic now uses LLM-driven analysis and live data
- Milestone 2 completed: Configurations are now externalized.
- Proceed to Milestone 3: Optimization and tuning (performance analysis, comprehensive backtesting)
- Milestone 4: Enhance monitoring (alerts, expanded metrics)
