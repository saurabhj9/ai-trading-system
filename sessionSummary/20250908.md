# Session Summary: 2025-09-08

This document summarizes the progress and key decisions made for the `ai-trading-system` project on this date.

## Project Goal

To create a multi-agent AI system for financial analysis and trade signal generation, inspired by the `virattt/ai-hedge-fund` repository but with our own technology choices.

## Key Decisions & Architecture

1.  **Package Management:** We will use **UV** for dependency and environment management.
2.  **Agent Orchestration:** We will use **LangChain/LangGraph** for a robust, stateful agent workflow instead of building a custom message bus.
3.  **Development Focus:** The initial priority is **backend-first**. We will build the core agentic engine and test it via a CLI and a simple FastAPI. The web UI will be deferred.
4.  **Backtesting Strategy:** We will use an established library (like `backtrader` or `vectorbt`) to handle the simulation. For backtesting, we will create simplified, **deterministic models** of the LLM-based agents to ensure speed and repeatability.
5.  **Data Strategy:** Initial development will be done using **daily** market data.

## Current Status

- The project directory structure has been created (`src`, `docs`, `tests`, etc.).
- A full suite of documentation files (`README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TODO.md`, etc.) has been created as placeholders.
- The `README.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` files have been populated with initial content reflecting the decisions above.
- We are currently paused because the `uv` command was not found in the system's PATH for the Gemini CLI session.

## Next Step

The user will restart the Gemini CLI session. After restarting, the immediate next step is to run `uv init` to initialize the Python project in the root directory.

## Session Summary: 2025-09-08 (Continued)

This section summarizes the work completed in the current session.

### Project Setup & Dependencies

-   Successfully initialized the project using `uv init`.
-   Updated `pyproject.toml` with all specified dependencies.
-   Replaced `empyrical` and `pyfolio` with `empyrical-reloaded` and `quantstats` due to compatibility and maintenance concerns, ensuring a more robust dependency set.
-   All project dependencies were successfully installed using `uv sync`.
-   Configured `pytest` in `pyproject.toml` to correctly resolve module imports during testing.
-   Installed `pre-commit` hooks to enforce code quality standards.

### Documentation Updates

-   Fleshed out `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with a detailed overview of the system's design, including agent architecture, communication, data pipeline, and deployment.
-   Created `docs/ROADMAP.md` outlining the high-level development phases and their key deliverables.
-   Populated `docs/TODO.md` with concrete, actionable tasks for Phase 1.
-   Updated `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/TODO.md` to reflect the completion of Phase 1 and to detail the tasks for Phase 2.

### Phase 1: Core Framework & Agent Development (Completed)

All milestones for Phase 1 have been successfully implemented and tested:

-   **Foundational Data Structures:** Defined `AgentConfig`, `MarketData`, and `AgentDecision` in `src/agents/data_structures.py`.
-   **Base Agent Implementation:** Created the abstract `BaseAgent` class in `src/agents/base.py`.
-   **Initial Technical Agent:** Implemented `TechnicalAnalysisAgent` in `src/agents/technical.py` with a placeholder analysis method and corresponding unit tests.
-   **State Management:** Developed a simple in-memory `StateManager` in `src/communication/state_manager.py` with accompanying unit tests.
-   **Basic Orchestration:** Implemented a basic `Orchestrator` using `langgraph` to manage the `TechnicalAnalysisAgent` workflow in `src/communication/orchestrator.py`, along with an integration test.

All unit and integration tests are currently passing, indicating a stable foundation for further development.

### Next Steps

The project is now ready to proceed with **Phase 2: Data Pipeline & Integration**, as outlined in `docs/ROADMAP.md` and detailed in `docs/TODO.md`.
